# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in the latest version, please email me directly at hank@henrygd.me, or [submit a private advisory](https://github.com/henrygd/beszel/security/advisories/new).

If you submit an advisory, open an empty issue as well to let me know that you did (or email me), as I'm not sure if I get notifications for that.

If the issue is low severity (use best judgement) you may open an issue for it instead of contacting me directly.
